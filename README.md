# Iâ€™m Sun â€“ Building Optimized, Engaging, Scalable Tech That Empowers Communities  

## **Why I Build**  
I believe technology should **serve people first**, creating solutions that are **intuitive, accessible, and impactful**. Whether itâ€™s helping museums engage audiences, empowering civic tech initiatives, or leveraging Web3 for community-driven tools*, I build with purposeâ€”**technology that connects, informs, and enhances real-world experiences**.  

## **How I Work**  
I approach every challenge with a blend of **engineering precision and creative problem-solving**:  
- **Strong technical foundations** in **cloud architecture, database optimization, and AI-driven recommendations**.  
- **Deep problem-solver**â€”whether itâ€™s optimizing **geospatial data for grant discovery** or designing **interactive museum experiences**.  
- **Creative meets technical**â€”a background in **woodworking and fabrication** sharpened my **spatial reasoning and engineering mindset**.  
- **Always learning**â€”exploring **Go/Golang, DevOps, Docker, Next.js, and AI tools** to **push my skill set further**.  

## **What I Build**  
I specialize in **JavaScript/TypeScript, Express, Python/Flask, iOS/Swift, Nextjs, React, Cloud & Micro-service Architecture, and UI frameworks like Chakra & Tailwind**, creating **scalable, intuitive applications** that drive **efficiency, accessibility, and impact**.  

Whether itâ€™s **an engaging museum app** or **a civic tool that strengthens communities**, I focus on solutions that make a difference.
